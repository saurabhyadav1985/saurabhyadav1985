👋 Hello, I'm Saurabh Yadav!

🚀 As a dedicated software engineer with a focus on backend Java development, I am on a mission to make a meaningful impact through open source contributions. I thrive on the collaborative nature of the open source community and relish connecting with like-minded peers.

🌐 While I may not be a heavy maintainer of large libraries, I am a firm believer in the "boyscout rule" — always leave the codebase cleaner than you found it. My contributions stem from a genuine passion for solving problems and a desire to help others navigate potential challenges. I contribute to projects when I encounter issues that I believe might pose difficulties for fellow developers.

💡 Join me on this exciting journey as we explore the realms of software engineering together. Let's make a difference, one contribution at a time! 🔍✨
